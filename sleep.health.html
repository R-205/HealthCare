<pre>
Are you spending more time trying to fall asleep rather than actually sleeping? You’re not alone.

It’s estimated that 1 in 3Trusted Source people in the United States experience sleep deprivation.
The number of hours recommended for sleep depends on your age. But most people need at
least 7Trusted Source hours of sleep in a 24-hour period.

<b>A lack of sleep may pose adverse psychological and physiological effects, such as:</b>
<ul type="square">
<li>constant fatigue, restlessness, or irritability</li>
<li>decreased performance, concentration, and memory</li>
<li>increased risk of depression and anxiety</li>
<li>increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity</li>
</ul>
Just the act of trying too hard to fall asleep may cause a cycle of anxious,nerve-wracking energy
that keeps you awake. If your mind can’t sleep,it’s difficult for your body to follow, too.

<b>There are three essential factors to consider before trying to fall asleep:</b>
<ul type="square">
<li>sleeping hygiene</li>
<li>bedroom environment</li>
<li>what you do during the day</li>
</ul>
 <h2>How can you fall asleep right away at night?</h2>
If you’ve got these all under control and you’re still having difficulty falling asleep,
we have a few anecdotal methods to help you flip the switch.

<b>10 seconds</b>

It usually takes a magic spell to fall asleep this quickly and on cue, but practice may
help you reach the 10-second sweet spot.


<b>The military method :</b>
<ol type="number">
<li>Relax your entire face, including the muscles inside your mouth.</li>
<li>Drop your shoulders to release the tension, and let your hands drop to the side of your body.</li>
<li>Exhale, relaxing your chest.</li>
<li>Relax your legs, thighs, and calves.</li>
<li>Clear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene.</li>
<li>If this doesn’t work, try saying “don’t think” repeatedly for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Within 10 seconds, you should fall asleep!</li>
</ol>If this doesn’t work, you may need to work on the foundations of the military method:breathing
and muscle relaxation. Some conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) or anxiety, may also interfere with this method’s effectiveness.

<b>60 seconds</b>

One article Trusted Source suggests that slow breathing, sleep hygiene, and relaxation methods
may be more useful to help treat insomnia than some common pharmacological treatments.

The following method is meant to help quiet your mind by focusing on your breathing and
relaxing your muscles.If you’re a beginner, these may take up to 2 minutes to work.


<b>cycle of 4-7-8 breathing method :</b>
<ol type="number">
<li>Let your lips part slightly and make a whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.</li>
<li>Close your lips and inhale silently through your nose. Count to 4 in your head.</li>
<li>Hold your breath for 7 seconds. This is the most important part of the practice.</li>
<li>Exhale (with a whoosh sound) for 8 seconds.</li>
<li>When you breathe in again, a new cycle begins.</li>
<li>When you breathe in again, a new cycle begins.</li>
</ol>

<b>120 seconds</b>

If the previous methods don’t work for you, then consider one of the following.

<b>Tell yourself to stay awake</b>

For people with insomnia, trying to fall asleep might increase performance anxiety.

Research from 2021Trusted Source suggests that paradoxical intention (PI) may help reduce sleep<br>performance anxiety and increase the perception of feeling well-rested after sleep. PI is a technique<br>in which you intentionally stay awake in bed. This is meant to help you overcome the fear and<br>conscious effort of falling asleep.

This method may be more effective than traditional, intentional breathing practices. However,
research is limited.

<b>Visualize a calm place</b>

If counting is too stimulating, engaging your imagination may be a better alternative.

In a 2002 study from the University of Oxford, researchers found that people who engaged<br>in “imagery distraction” fell asleep faster than those who had general distraction or no <br>instructions.

<b>Acupressure for sleep</b>

A 2019 meta-analysisTrusted Source suggests that acupressure may slightly decrease the time<br>you fall asleep. It may also increase your sleep efficiency and duration. However, there’s limited<br>research to determine whether acupressure is beneficial.

Three specific pressure points may be more beneficial than others to help you fall asleep faster.

<b>1. Spirit gate</b>

<b>The technique :</b>
<ol type="number">
<li>Feel for the small, hollow space under your palm on your pinky side.</li>
<li>Gently apply pressure in a circular or up-and-down movement for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Press down the left side of the point (palm facing) with gentle pressure for a few<br>seconds, then hold the right side (back-of-hand facing).</li>
<li>Repeat on the same area of your other wrist.</li>
</ol>

<b>2. Inner frontier gate</b>

<img src="photos/sleep4.jpg" alt="sleep Image" class= "images" />

<b>The technique :</b>
<ol type="number">
<li>Count three finger-widths down from your wrist crease on one palm facing up.</li>
<li>With your thumb, apply a steady downward pressure between the two tendons.</li>
<li>You can massage in a circular or up-and-down motion until you feel your muscles relax.</li>
</ol>
