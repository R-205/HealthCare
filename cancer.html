Cancer occurs when genetic mutations in abnormal cells cause them to divide rapidly. 
You can inherit mutations or develop them due to environmental factors.

<pre>
Cancer is a large group of diseases that occur when abnormal cells divide rapidly and can
spread to other tissue and organs.

These rapidly growing cells may cause tumors. They may also disrupt the body’s regular function.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO)Trusted Source, cancer accounted for almost 1 in 6 deaths in 2020.
Experts are working hard to test out new cancer treatments every day.
 
<h2>What causes cancer?</h2>
The main cause of cancer is mutations, or changes to the DNA in your cells. Genetic mutations
can be inherited.They can also occur after birth as a result of environmental forces.

These external causes, called carcinogens, can include:
<ul type="square">
<li>physical carcinogens like radiation and ultraviolet (UV) light</li>
<li>chemical carcinogens like cigarette smoke, asbestos, alcohol, air pollution,<br> and contaminated food and drinking water</li>
<li>biological carcinogens like viruses, bacteria, and parasites</li>
</ul>
According to the WHOTrusted Source, about 33 percent of cancer deaths may be caused by tobacco,
alcohol, high body mass index (BMI), low fruit and vegetable consumption, and not getting
enough physical activity.

<h2>Types of cancer</h2>
Cancers are named for the area in which they begin and the type of cell they are made of, even if they spread to other parts of the body. For example, a cancer that begins in the lungs and spreads to the liver is still called lung cancer.

<b>There are also several clinical terms used for certain general types of cancer:</b>
<ul type="square">
<li>Carcinoma is a cancer that starts in the skin or the tissues that line other organs.</li>
<li>Sarcoma is a cancer of connective tissues such as bones, muscles, cartilage, and blood vessels.</li>
<li>Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow, which creates blood cells.</li>
<li>Lymphoma and myeloma are cancers of the immune system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk factors</h2>
Certain risk factors may increase your chance of developing cancer.
These risk factors can include:
<ul type="square">
<li>tobacco use</li>
<li>high alcohol consumption</li>
<li>a lack of physical activity</li>
<li>exposure to air pollution</li>
<li>exposure to radiation</li>
<li>unprotected exposure to UV light, such as sunlight</li>
</ul>
The risk of developing cancer also increases with age. In general,the risk of developing cancer appears
to increase until the age of 70 to 80Trusted Source and then diminish,according to the National Cancer
Institute (NCI).

<h2>The importance of early detection</h2>
Early detection is when cancer is found in its early stages. This can increase the effectiveness of
treatment and lower the mortality rate.

Cancer screenings may help detect signs of cancer early. Some common cancer screenings may
detect:
<ul type="square">
<li>Cervical cancer and prostate cancer. Some screenings, such as for cervical cancer and<br> prostate cancer, may be done as part of routine exams.</li>
<li>Lung cancer. Screenings for lung cancer may be performed regularly for those who have<br> certain risk factors.</li>
<li>Skin cancer. Skin cancer screenings may be performed by a dermatologist if you have<br> skin concerns or are at risk of skin cancer.</li>
<li>Colorectal cancer. The American Cancer Society (ACS)Trusted Source recommends regular<br> screenings for colorectal cancer beginning at age 45. These screenings are typically<br> performed during a colonoscopy. At-home testing kits may also be able to detect<br> some forms of colorectal cancer, according to a 2017 review of researchTrusted Source.</li>
<li>Breast cancer. Mammograms to test for breast cancer are recommended for women ages 45<br> and olderTrusted Source, but you may choose to begin screenings at age 40. In people<br> at a high risk, screenings may be recommended earlier.</li>
</ul>
If you have a family history of cancer or have a high risk of developing cancer,
it is important to follow a doctor’s screening recommendations.
